## ðŸ“œ Overview

**BrailloComm** is an innovative, cost-effective refreshable braille display designed to make text-based information more accessible to the visually impaired. Using a compact, servo-powered design, BrailloComm translates spoken language into braille, offering an affordable and user-friendly way for visually impaired users to interact with written content.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Modern braille technologies often come with high costs and limited portability, which restrict access for many visually impaired users. Our project addresses these limitations by providing an efficient, affordable, and portable solution, leveraging micro servo motors and open-source hardware for ease of use and widespread adoption.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Affordable Design**: Reduces braille display costs by up to 30% using micro servo technology.
- **Portable & Lightweight**: Compact construction with PVC and lightweight components makes it easy to carry.
- **Easy Operation**: Simplified hardware and user-friendly controls make setup and maintenance straightforward.
- **Voice-to-Braille Conversion**: Transforms spoken language into braille patterns.
- **Expanded Language Support**: Adapting the model to support braille translation for additional languages.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Components

- **Arduino UNO**: Acts as the primary processing unit.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Facilitates voice input conversion to text.
- **SG90 Micro Servos**: Control braille display pin positions.
- **LiPo Battery**: Provides portable power for the device.

## ðŸ§© Software Implementation

The BrailloComm software stack combines Python and Arduino to deliver real-time, voice-to-braille functionality:
- **Python**: Converts speech to text on the Raspberry Pi.
- **Arduino**: Maps text characters to braille patterns and drives servo motors to display each braille character.

## ðŸ“Š Results and Analysis

**BrailloComm** underwent rigorous testing and analysis to validate its functionality:
- **Readability**: Demonstrated high accuracy in character recognition for visually impaired users.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Provides a significantly lower-cost solution compared to traditional braille devices.
- **Portability**: Compact and lightweight, making it suitable for everyday use.

## ðŸš€ Future Work

Future improvements could include:
- **Sensor Integration**: Adding touch-sensitive or ultrasonic sensors to enhance the user experience.
